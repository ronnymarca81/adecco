- Route redirection.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for seamless organization.
- Responsive design optimized for being using with desktop and mobile devices.

### Case Analysis

In this case the client required an application with a login and a task manager with drag and drop like Trello. According with the information provided the analysis is:

For the login page, there could be differents options:
- Authentication with username (email) and password which are stored in a database. Once the user types the credentials, those are verified in the database and if they match, the user can access.
- If the company has corporate mail, the authentication can be through it.
- Authentication with third parties such as: Gmail, Facebook and others.
- Password recovery. When the user asks for this, an email is sent to the registered account to reset the password and access.

About the planner Trello-type, the application could have Kanban groups which manages lists and inside those you can have tasks. Those tasks could be assigned to members, also they could manage the tasks with checklists, schedule and labels.

For this short sprint?? the login is through authentication the user credentials (email and password), as well as recovering the access via email. Users can create one dashboard/kanban for each of their projects, on it they can add cards/columns with a task list. Each task can be drag and drop between the differents cards according its state to manage the project.
