## Features

**It is an activity planner, that allows you to create lists of activities and within the lists create tasks, with the ease of being able to drag and drop the lists to organize them as you wish and additionally allows you to move tasks between lists.**

- Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- Route redirection.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for seamless organization.
- Responsive design optimized for being using with desktop and mobile devices.

### Case Analysis

In this case the client required an application with a login and a task manager with drag and drop like Trello. According with the information provided the analysis is:

For the login page, there could be differents options:
- Authentication with username (email) and password which are stored in a database. Once the user types the credentials, those are verified in the database and if they match, the user can access.
- If the company has corporate mail, the authentication can be through it.
- Authentication with third parties such as: Gmail, Facebook and others.
- Password recovery. When the user asks for this, an email is sent to the registered account to reset the password and access.

About the planner Trello-type, the application could have Kanban groups which manages lists and inside those you can have tasks. Those tasks could be assigned to members, also they could manage the tasks with checklists, schedule and labels.

For this short sprint, we can start doing the login, Register and Kanban board features, the below we are going to describe them.
- Login Page: You can authenticate using the user credentials (email and password).
- Register Page: You can create an account in order to be able to login the application. You need to fill some fields like Full Name, email and password. There are some validations for Full Name field is requiered to have at least 10 characters, Password is requierd to   have at least 8 characters and email field is requiered to have a valid email format.
- Kanban Board Page: It will have three lists with preconfigured activities [Todo, Work in progress and Done], where you can drag and drop between the lists to organize them and sort tasks in a list or move a task to another list. Additionally, you can change the title     of the lists or description of the tasks, as well as delete lists and tasks.
  Finally, you can create new lists by clicking on the Add New List button.

This first sprint will be taken as a reference and will be shown to the end user to discover the set of functionalities they want for the application. Using agile methodologies and making partial deliveries with the purpose of building a solution that aligns with the needs.
